# Architecture documentation

This folder is the committed design record for the NIFTY multi-strategy trading
system. It answers "how is this thing built, and why is it built that way"
without requiring a reader to open the 17k-line master runner first.

It is **not** operator documentation. For setup, credentials, `.env` keys and
day-to-day commands, read the root [`README.md`](../README.md) and each
component folder's own `Readme.md`.

## Layout

| Folder | What lives there | When to read it |
|---|---|---|
| [`hld/`](hld/) | One high-level design covering the whole repository | First. Start with [`hld/system-overview.md`](hld/system-overview.md). |
| [`lld/`](lld/) | One low-level design per component | When changing that component. |
| [`adr/`](adr/) | Architecture Decision Records — the *why* behind decisions already baked in | Before proposing to reverse one. |
| `superpowers/` | Per-session agent plans and specs. **Untracked** (`.gitignore`). | Never — it is a working scratchpad, not product documentation. |

## Reading order for a new contributor

1. [`hld/system-overview.md`](hld/system-overview.md) — the process, the threads, the data flow.
2. [`lld/risk-and-safety.md`](lld/risk-and-safety.md) — this is live-money code; read the safety model before anything else.
3. [`lld/master-runner.md`](lld/master-runner.md) — startup gates, supervision, shutdown.
4. Then the LLD for whichever component you are touching.

## Keeping these documents honest

Architecture documents that drift are worse than no documents. Two habits keep
this set usable:

- **Change the LLD in the same commit as the code.** If a pull request changes
  how a component behaves, its LLD is part of that pull request.
- **Never restate a number the code owns.** Prefer "the default is defined in
  `Dependencies/env.example`" to copying the value here. Where a specific value
  genuinely matters to the design (the 10-second broker deadline, the 90%
  coverage budget), it is stated once with the file that owns it named next to it.

ADRs are append-only history. When a decision changes, add a new ADR that
supersedes the old one and mark the old one `Superseded`; do not edit the
original's decision.
