# ADR-0013: Dismiss the five CodeQL alerts rather than change the flagged code

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-31
**Deciders:** repository owner

## Context

GitHub code scanning reports **five open CodeQL alerts, all rated "high"**, against
`main`. They were reviewed one by one on 2026-08-31. **None is a vulnerability**,
and three of the five describe code whose removal would make this repository
measurably *less* safe.

| # | Rule | Location |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` | `Tests/Dependencies/test_secret_redaction.py:153` |
| 2 | `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` | `Tests/Dependencies/test_secret_redaction.py:157` |
| 3 | `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` | `Tests/Dependencies/test_secret_redaction.py:189` |
| 4 | `py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing` | `Dependencies/Shoonya API/NorenApi.py:229` |
| 5 | `py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing` | `Dependencies/Flattrade API/flattrade_execution.py:483` |

### Alerts 1–3: the redaction tests log a canary ON PURPOSE

Each flagged line logs a **canary** string — `CANARY-SUPER-SECRET`,
`CANARY-INSTALL-SECRET` — through a logger whose handler has `RedactingFilter`
installed, writing into an in-memory `io.StringIO`. The very next lines assert
`secret not in output` and `REDACTED in output`.

The logging call is not incidental to those tests; it **is** the test. It is the
only way to prove the filter scrubs a secret before it reaches a handler. Deleting
or defanging the call to satisfy the scanner would delete the coverage and leave
the redaction filter unverified.

That filter is not decorative. The earlier Dhan marketfeed put its live access
token in its websocket URL; a connection error could otherwise write a working
credential verbatim into a log file operators routinely share. The same
handler-level redaction remains in place for current provider and broker errors.
These three tests are what keep that from regressing silently.

The alerts are correct that a secret reaches a logging call. They cannot see that
the secret is fake, the sink is a memory buffer, and the assertion immediately
afterwards proves nothing escaped.

### Alert 4: Shoonya's wire protocol, in vendored code

`hashlib.sha256(password)` at `NorenApi.py:229` is what Shoonya's `/authorize`
endpoint requires on the wire. Two independent reasons not to change it:

- The digest format is **not ours to choose**. Substituting bcrypt/scrypt/argon2
  produces a value the broker rejects, breaking login outright.
- The file is a **vendored** third-party client (`CLAUDE.md`, Broker layer).
  Editing it silently forks the vendor's code and makes the next upgrade a manual
  merge.

The rule targets password **storage**, where an expensive KDF is the right answer
because an attacker who steals the store gets offline guesses. There is no password
store here: this is a transport digest computed in memory and sent immediately.

### Alert 5: not password hashing at all

`flattrade_execution.py:483` computes
`sha256(api_key + request_code + api_secret)`. That is Flattrade's documented
proof-of-possession for its token exchange, and the code already carries the
explanation:

> the API secret is never sent raw. Instead `sha256(api_key + request_code +
> api_secret)` proves we hold the secret while binding this exchange to THIS
> request code — a replayed digest is useless once the code expires.

CodeQL taints `raw_secret` as a "password" because of its name. The construction is
a keyed one-time proof, not a stored credential, and a slow KDF would be the wrong
primitive as well as a rejected one.

### Why dismissal, and not configuration

CodeQL here runs through GitHub's **default setup** (`state: configured`, no
workflow file, no config). Default setup does **not** read
`.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml`, so path filters and query exclusions are
unavailable. Adding such a file would be dead configuration that reads, to a future
maintainer, as protection that does not exist.

Dismissal with a recorded reason is therefore the supported remediation. It is also
the honest one: the finding is real as a pattern match and wrong as a conclusion,
which is exactly what "false positive" is for.

## Decision

1. **Change none of the five sites.**
2. **Dismiss all five alerts** with reasons recorded in GitHub: alerts 1–3 as *used
   in tests*, alerts 4–5 as *false positive*.
3. **Add a repository-policy guard** asserting the canary-logging tests still exist
   and still assert the secret is absent, so the "fix" this ADR rejects cannot be
   applied later by a well-meaning edit or an automated suggestion.
4. **Treat a recurrence as a dismissal, not a defect.** If these alerts reappear —
   after a re-scan, a CodeQL version bump, or a file move — re-dismiss them and
   point at this ADR. Do not patch the code to silence the scanner.

## Consequences

- The Security tab reads clean, and each dismissal carries a reason a reviewer can
  audit rather than an unexplained silence.
- The redaction coverage is now protected from both directions: the tests prove the
  filter works, and the policy guard proves the tests still exist.
- Alerts 4 and 5 will reappear if either broker file is substantially rewritten,
  since the flagged construction is inherent to both APIs. That is expected.
- The repository is **public**. Checked alongside this triage, and clean:
  `Dependencies/.env` was never committed, no credential/key/token files are
  tracked, and the only secret-shaped literal in tracked code is
  `"not-a-real-token"` in a broker test fixture.

## Action items

- [x] Review all five alerts against the source.
- [x] Record the triage here and link it from `docs/README.md`.
- [x] Add `test_secret_redaction_canary_coverage_survives_codeql_pressure` to
      `Tests/Dependencies/test_repository_policy.py`.
- [ ] Operator dismisses the five alerts in the Security tab with the reasons above.
