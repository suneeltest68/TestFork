NIFTY Multi-Strategy Front Test - Master Runner
================================================================================

WHAT THIS FILE IS (read this first if you have never seen this code base)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a single multi-threaded paper-trading runner that combines a core roster
plus independently opt-in NIFTY agents behind ONE shared market-data fetcher. It started as
the union of two earlier files plus one Greeks-driven addition:

  1. "Nifty Multi Strategy Front Test - DhanHQ ATM Options.py"
       - 4 strategies that trade single-leg ATM options of the
         next-next NIFTY expiry, BUY-only:
           * Renko          (1-min source)
           * EMA Trend      (1-min source, locally resampled to 5-min)
           * Heikin Ashi    (1-min source)
           * Profit Shooter (1-min source, locally resampled to 5-min)

  2. "Nifty Supertrend Front Test - DhanHQ Hedged Puts.py"
       - 2 strategies that trade two-leg HEDGED option spreads of the
         current-week NIFTY expiry. Strike selection here is by
         "live premium closest to a target":
           * Supertrend Bullish: SELL ~Rs.160 PE + BUY ~Rs.10 PE
                                 (locally resampled to 3-min)
           * Donchian   Bearish: SELL ~Rs.160 CE + BUY ~Rs.10 CE
                                 (locally resampled to 5-min)

  3. Delta-0.2 Hedged Spread (this file only)
       - 1 strategy that runs TWO independent hedged spreads at once
         (one CE side, one PE side) of the current-week expiry. Strike
         selection is by Greek (delta), not by premium:
           * At 09:20 IST it pulls the live option chain, picks the CE
             with delta closest to +0.20 and the PE with delta closest
             to -0.20, and stores their LTPs as reference premiums.
           * A side enters when its monitored leg's LTP drops 5% below
             the reference: SELL the monitored strike, BUY the strike
             4 strikes further OTM (CE: higher; PE: lower) as a hedge.
           * Per-side exit at 3x the reference; strategy-wide max-loss
             of Rs.5000/lot; force exit at 15:20.

Since that union, FOUR more single-leg ATM strategies were added directly to
this master file -- Goldmine, Money Machine (both 5-min, Subhamoy folder),
Opening Strike PCR/VWAP/ATR (5-min), and CPR (5-min) -- which brought the runner
to eleven strategies (8 ATM single-leg + 2 Hedged Puts + 1 Delta-0.2).

Most recently, THIRTEEN more single-leg ATM strategies were added -- ports of the
public TradingBot project (kept in the "Signal Generators" folder), built
from one shared factory: SMA Crossover, Bollinger Bands, Keltner Squeeze, Mean
Reversion Z-Score, ML Ensemble, Multi-Timeframe, Opening Range Breakout, Parabolic
SAR, RSI Divergence, RSI Reversal, Stochastic, Supertrend, and Volatility
Breakout. They are the SAME ATM single-leg family (a LONG buys the ATM CE, a SHORT
the ATM PE). (ML Ensemble needs scikit-learn.)

Two more were then added. CPR Algo 3 is a multi-instrument "CPR basic setup" ATM
worker: it watches the spot PLUS a ~ITM CE and a ~ITM PE of the current-week expiry
and only fires when VWAP and the CPR band align across all three, but it still
trades the ATM CE/PE of the next-next expiry like the rest of the ATM family. The
Long Strangle worker is a time-based two-leg BUY of the OTM1 weekly CE+PE, with
independent per-leg trailing stops and momentum re-entry.

Newest is Regime Adaptive, a port from a DIFFERENT public project
(workratananmol-hub/nifty-options-paper-trading-bot, MIT). It is one ATM
single-leg worker that switches RULE on ADX: an opening-range breakout when the
market trends, a fade back to VWAP when it ranges, and no trade at all when ADX
is missing. Everything for it lives in "Signal Generators/Regime Adaptive Strategy/";
its two candidate rules sit there in "regime_candidates.py"
as library code with no worker of their own, so the router can never double up on
a candidate's signal. Read that folder's REGIME_PORTING_NOTES.md before
enabling it live: this runner has no volume, so its VWAP is an equal-weight proxy.

CPR Algo 4 followed: the operator's "Intraday SRSI VWAP" playbook with every
decision made by fixed rules -- the same ideas the optional CPR Codex AI Agent
below judges with a model. The 09:25 close against [MIN(S1, PDL), MAX(R1, PDH)]
fixes the day type: SIDEWAYS days trade Stochastic RSI reversals, TRENDING days
trade VWAP pullbacks and flip direction on swing structure. It trades the ATM
CE/PE of the next-next expiry like the rest of the family; its broker-free
engine lives in "Signal Generators/CPR Strategy/cpr_algo4_signal_generator.py"
and the backtest drives exactly the same code.

Together they form an approximately TWENTY-EIGHT-strategy core roster: 24 ATM
single-leg + 2 Hedged Puts + 1 Delta-0.2 + 1 Long Strangle. Per-strategy virtual
gates decide which subset actually runs.

Two OPTIONAL agents can be independently opted in alongside that core roster.
One is the SL Hunting AI Agent
(under "Signal Generators/SL Hunting AI Agent/"). Unlike every other strategy it
is LLM-driven -- a Claude agent (claude-agent-sdk, on your Claude subscription)
decides once per completed 1-min bar (the method's native timeframe) via in-process
tools -- with optional BankNIFTY cross-confirmation fetched per bar (like CPR Algo 3)
and fail-closed hard-budget sizing -- then acts through this runner's own
enter_position/exit_position (so it is just another ATM single-leg member of the
family). It stops opening NEW positions after 10:30
(SL_HUNTING_NO_NEW_ENTRY_HOUR default 10 and SL_HUNTING_NO_NEW_ENTRY_MINUTE
default 30); that is NOT a square-off -- open positions, their stop/target, and the
15:15 square-off are all unaffected, and when flat past the cutoff it skips the LLM
call entirely. It is OFF by default; SL_HUNTING_ENABLED=true includes it, and its
optional deps (claude-agent-sdk, pydantic) are imported behind try/except so a missing
dep simply disables it without touching the rest of the runner. It can also learn from
its own trades (v3): a per-trade journal feeds an off-loop reflection coach that
proposes lessons, which the operator promotes into lessons.json and the agent injects
only when SL_HUNTING_LESSONS_ENABLED (human-gated, paper-first, off by default).
The other is the CPR Codex AI Agent, an independent five-minute Trend-Day Rider:
the host flags trend-day candidates, Codex may only accept or veto them (and judge
premise exits), and every entry sells the opposite current-week ATM option.
When both optional agents are enabled, the configured roster can reach approximately
30 workers; enable and virtual-trading gates keep the running total configuration-dependent.

EXPIRY RULES (the explicit if-else the user asked for)
------------------------------------------------------
Different strategies pick different expiries. Rather than burying this
in a single overloaded method, every worker is explicit about which
expiry rule it uses:

    if strategy belongs to the "Hedged Puts" family, is the Long Strangle,
    is SL Hunting's NIFTY leg (SLH-008), or is a CPR AI (Trend-Day Rider) entry
        -> use OptionsContractResolver.get_current_week_expiry()
           (the FIRST expiry on or after today)
    else
        -> use OptionsContractResolver.get_target_expiry()
           (the SECOND expiry on or after today, i.e. "next-next")

ATM workers select this via the `_entry_expiry()` hook, which returns None
(= the resolver's next-next default) unless a subclass overrides it.

(CPR Algo 3 is "else" -- it TRADES the next-next ATM -- even though its read-only
observation legs use the current-week expiry. CPR Algo 4 also remains "else".)

One deliberate exception (BNF-001): the SL Hunting BankNIFTY MIRROR leg uses
OptionsContractResolver.get_nearest_monthly_expiry() -- the NEAREST BankNIFTY
monthly expiry, which it NEVER rolls forward. BankNIFTY lists only monthly
series, so "next-next" would park an intraday mirror in the illiquid second
month out.

BNF-002 (2026-07-23): the mirror also never rolls to the NEXT month in expiry
week, because Kotak rejects MIS (intraday) orders on next-month contracts and
the live mirror leg kept failing to fire. Expiry week is handled on the STRIKE
axis instead -- inside SL_HUNTING_BNF_MIRROR_ROLLOVER_DAYS the mirror buys a
deep ITM strike (get_itm_option) whose value is mostly intrinsic, rather than a
near-expiry ATM contract that is almost pure decaying time premium.

SLH-008 (2026-07-29): the same Kotak RMS rule reached the NIFTY leg -- MIS is
allowed only on the current WEEKLY or the monthly contract, and "next-next"
is neither in roughly three weeks out of four, so live entries were rejected
and silently fell back to paper. The NIFTY leg therefore also trades the
current-week expiry now. Beyond the broker, it is the right instrument: this
strategy holds for minutes, and its whole knowledge base is distilled from a
trader who is always in the near/expiring series.

Both methods live on the same resolver so the choice is one line at
the call site. That keeps the rule visible in the code and easy to
audit later without chasing a hidden flag.

STRIKE RULES (also explicit per family)
---------------------------------------
- ATM family (the 24 core ATM workers plus any optional ATM agents) ->
  resolver.get_atm_option(spot, dir).
  Picks the strike whose round-50 value is nearest to live spot.
- Hedged family (Supertrend Bullish + Donchian Bearish) -> the strike
  selection lives INSIDE each dedicated worker
  (`_pick_hedged_puts` / `_pick_hedged_calls`). Those workers use
  resolver primitives (`list_puts_for_expiry`, `list_calls_for_expiry`,
  `pick_put_by_target_premium`, `pick_call_by_target_premium`) but the
  end-to-end "pick a hedged pair" recipe is per-strategy, because each
  hedged strategy could plausibly want different premium thresholds
  later (e.g. a different target premium for a different volatility
  regime).

EXECUTION MODEL CHEAT SHEET (paper)
-----------------------------------
Single-leg ATM trades (the core and optional ATM workers):
    PnL = (exit_option_price - entry_option_price) * qty
    Both LONG and SHORT signals open as BUY legs (CE for LONG, PE for
    SHORT). PnL is therefore always (live - entry) * qty.

Hedged spreads (the 2 Hedged workers):
    PnL_main  = (entry_premium - exit_premium) * qty   (we SOLD this leg)
    PnL_hedge = (exit_premium - entry_premium) * qty   (we BOUGHT this leg)
    Total     = PnL_main + PnL_hedge

THREAD ARCHITECTURE
-------------------
- One `CentralMarketDataFetcher` thread:
    * Pulls live 1-minute NIFTY OHLC every poll.
    * Pulls LTPs for NIFTY spot AND every option leg currently held by
      ANY worker (batched Fyers quote calls).
    * Publishes everything into a thread-safe `SharedMarketDataStore`.

- Configured `*StrategyWorker` threads:
    * Read the 1-minute OHLC from the shared store.
    * Resample locally if their strategy timeframe is higher than 1m.
    * Run their own signal generator (the Delta-0.2 worker is the
      exception and reads option-chain Greeks instead of OHLC).
    * Manage their own paper position (single-leg OR hedged).
    * Never call the broker for OHLC directly. They only do tiny
      direct LTP fallback fetches when the cache is cold.

This central-fetcher design keeps API usage low and makes the data
deterministic across every enabled strategy.

WHY ONE FILE INSTEAD OF SEPARATE FILES
--------------------------------------
- Single fetch budget. One batched Fyers quote request covers spot plus
  every active option leg from every worker simultaneously.
- One log destination. Every enabled strategy shares LOG_FILE so a single
  audit trail captures the day.
- One process to start, one Ctrl+C to stop everything cleanly.

        +-- LongStrangleWorker         (time-based two-leg BUY OTM1 CE+PE, momentum re-entry)

The split is intentional: the core ATM workers, TradingBot ports, and optional
ATM agents share an `enter_position` / `exit_position` flow, so it is hosted on
`AtmSingleLegStrategyWorker`. The hedged workers each implement
their own enter / exit because the position shape, leg count, and
PnL math differ - and the Delta-0.2 worker further differs in that
it carries TWO simultaneous hedged positions (one CE, one PE) and
ignores OHLC entirely (its triggers are option-leg LTPs against a
09:20 reference).

# =============================================================================
# DELTA-0.2 HEDGED SPREAD STRATEGY CONSTANTS (Tier 3)
# =============================================================================
# Background for readers new to options trading:
#
# - "Delta" is one of the option Greeks. For a CALL, delta ranges from 0
#   (deep OTM, market expects strike won't be reached) to ~1 (deep ITM).
#   For a PUT, delta is reported as a negative number from -1 (deep ITM)
#   to 0 (deep OTM). A common shorthand is "20-delta strike" meaning
#   |delta| ~= 0.20 - i.e. the option roughly has a 20% chance of
#   finishing in-the-money. These are typically a few strikes OTM.
#
# - "Premium" = the price of the option contract (its LTP).
#
# - "OTM" = Out-of-the-money. For CE it means strike > spot; for PE it
#   means strike < spot. Hedging here means BUYING a further-OTM option
#   so a runaway move against us has a hard cap on the loss.
#
# - This is a CREDIT spread: we SELL the monitored strike (collecting
#   premium) and BUY a cheaper further-OTM strike (paying a small
#   premium). Net = positive credit. We profit if both legs expire
#   worthless or if the monitored leg's price decays.
#
# Strategy spec (the user's brief; one CE side + one PE side, INDEPENDENT):
#
#   1. At DELTA20_TRADING_START_*:* (default 09:20), pull the live option
#      chain for the current-week expiry and pick:
#        * the CE strike with delta closest to +DELTA20_TARGET_DELTA
#        * the PE strike with delta closest to -DELTA20_TARGET_DELTA
#      Snapshot each leg's premium at that moment as the "reference".
#
#   2. ENTRY (per side, independent of the other side):
#      When the monitored CE/PE leg's LTP falls to <= ref * (1 - drop)
#      (default: 5% drop), open the spread:
#        * SELL the monitored strike (this is the "main" leg)
#        * BUY the strike DELTA20_HEDGE_STRIKES_OTM further OTM
#          (CE side: higher strike; PE side: lower strike) for cap-loss
#          protection.
#      A side may enter even if the other side is already running.
#
#   3. EXIT conditions (per side, independent):
#      a. The monitored strike's LTP reaches DELTA20_EXIT_MULTIPLIER x
#         the reference premium (default: 3x). Closes ONLY that side.
#         Reading: "the option got 3x more expensive => the market is
#         pushing toward our short strike => bail out before assignment."
#      b. STRATEGY-WIDE max-loss: realized + open PnL across BOTH sides
#         <= -(DELTA20_MAX_LOSS_PER_LOT * lots). Closes everything AND
#         stops the worker for the day.
#      c. Time cutoff at DELTA20_SQUARE_OFF_*:* (default 15:20). Closes
#         anything still open.
#
#   Once a side has exited it is NOT re-opened the same day. The
#   monitor + hedge LTP subscriptions for that side are released so we
#   stop spending API budget watching them.

#   each has its own 5% premium stop-loss with a "1:1" trailing stop (every +1%

#   still open is force-closed at STRANGLE_SQUARE_OFF_*:* (default 15:15).

        Why this helper exists:
        - Fyers' live option-chain endpoint reports per-strike Greeks
          but does NOT include our broker-side `security_id`.
        - To place a paper trade (or subscribe to LTP updates) we need
          the security_id from the instrument-master CSV.
        - This helper bridges the two: given an (expiry, strike, right),
          it returns the matching CSV row's identifiers.

        Used by `Delta20HedgedSpreadWorker` to:
          1. Map a strike chosen via the live option_chain Greeks back
             into our instrument-master row (which has security_id and
             lot_size).
          2. Resolve the hedge leg (4 strikes further OTM) once the
             monitor leg's strike is known.

        Args:
            expiry: A `date` matching one of the listed weekly expiries.
            strike: The requested strike level (e.g. 22500.0). We tolerate
                tiny float drift (e.g. 22500.000001 vs 22500.0) by
                rejecting matches whose absolute strike-diff exceeds 0.5.
            right: "CE" or "PE" (case-insensitive).

        Returns:

    Two threads cooperate inside this producer:

    * The SUPERVISOR is this thread's own `run()` loop (wakes twice a second,
      never blocks on the socket). It seeds warmup history from REST, keeps
      the feed's subscriptions in sync with the workers' option legs,
      publishes the merged frame into the store, trues-up completed candles
      from REST once per minute, and records market-data health on the same
      FETCH_POLL_SECONDS cadence as the REST producer.
    * The PUMP is an inner daemon thread that owns the websocket: it builds a
      FRESH Fyers data socket per connection attempt (see `make_market_feed`),
      then loops `get_data()`, feeding every price tick into the LTP cache
      and every live NIFTY index tick into the `TickBarAggregator`. On any
      socket error it reconnects with exponential backoff, re-subscribing
      the full desired instrument set by construction.

    Bar semantics: the published frame is always
    ``merge_official_and_tick_frames(official REST history, tick bars)``.
    Official REST candles win only for minutes proved final at the REST
    request's start. The forming minute and a newly closed minute still inside
    the grace period remain tick-built until a later true-up proves them final.
    Every publish still goes through `store.update()` and its
    `validate_ohlc_frame` net. Consumers are untouched: same store, same
    snapshot shape, same health gates.

    """
    Abstract base class for every strategy worker thread.

    What the base does for everyone:
    - Owns the main `run()` loop (risk -> time cutoff -> pre-open wait ->
      snapshot read -> signature gate -> dispatch).
    - Provides `_get_option_ltp` and `_get_underlying_spot` helpers that
      read the shared cache first and only fall back to a direct broker
      call if the cache is empty.
    - Supplies max-loss and time-cutoff shutdown wrappers that close any
      open paper trade and halt the worker for the day.
    - Defines the synthetic paper-order-id generator.

    What the base does NOT do:
    - It does not know how a specific strategy converts OHLC into signals.
    - It does not know whether the worker uses single-leg or hedged
      execution.
    Both of those are the subclass's job.

    Subclass contract:
    - `build_strategy_frame(ohlc) -> pd.DataFrame`
        Transform 1-minute OHLC into the strategy's working DataFrame
        (resample if needed, attach indicator columns).
    - `process_strategy_frame(strategy_frame) -> None`
        Inspect the latest row and decide whether to enter / exit.
    - `exit_position(reason)` and `_get_open_position_pnl()`
        Close the current paper position and report MTM PnL. Default stubs
        do nothing so the cutoff handlers never crash on flat workers.

# OPENING STRIKE PCR VWAP ATR WORKER (5-min, ATM single-leg)
# =============================================================================
class OpeningStrikePCRVWAPATRWorker(AtmSingleLegStrategyWorker):
    """
    Opening Strike PCR / VWAP / ATR strategy on a 5-minute derived series.

    PLAIN-ENGLISH WALKTHROUGH (for first-time readers)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    What this strategy is trying to do, conceptually:

    1. Right after the market opens, this worker remembers ONE special
       strike: the NIFTY ATM strike based on the day's opening price. That
       single strike is called the "opening strike" and is FIXED for the
       rest of the day. Every PCR (Put/Call ratio) calculation downstream
       uses a small window of strikes centred on this anchor.

    2. The worker watches the option-chain OPEN-INTEREST (OI) "change"
       around that opening strike. OI change is just "how much new OI got
       added today" -- put OI growing fast means option WRITERS believe
       NIFTY won't fall (bullish), call OI growing fast means writers
       believe NIFTY won't rise (bearish).

    3. On every closed 5-minute candle, ask the signal engine: "Given the
       current OI flow + this candle's VWAP/ATR/price action, do we want
       to BUY_CALL, BUY_PUT, or do nothing?". The engine combines PCR,
       candle colour, VWAP position, and (optionally) RSI to answer.

    4. On a BUY_CALL signal: buy the ATM Call option. On BUY_PUT: buy the
       ATM Put. We always BUY (never sell) options here, so the worst-case
       loss per trade is bounded at the premium paid.

    5. Manage the trade with a "ratcheting" stop loss applied on the
       OPTION'S PREMIUM (NOT on NIFTY spot):
         * initial SL = entry_premium - 20 points
         * once the option moves +2R in our favour (where 1R = 20 pts),
           ratchet SL up to entry + 1R (locks in 1R profit).
         * at +3R reward, ratchet to entry + 2R, and so on.
       The "high-water" rule means SL only moves UP, never back down.

    6. At 15:15 IST sharp the worker force-closes any running trade and
       stops for the day. This happens whether or not a signal ever fired
       -- the daily session cutoff is unconditional. See "SQUARE-OFF
       SAFETY NET" below for details.

    WHY THIS WORKER IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ATM WORKERS
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Renko / EMA / HeikinAshi / ProfitShooter look at NIFTY OHLC only.
    THIS worker ALSO needs live option-chain data, because the PCR signal
    is what the engine actually keys off. So we:

    - Call `broker.fetch_option_chain` no more often than the configured
      refresh interval; concurrent workers share the short-lived response cache.
    - Snapshot OI per strike on the FIRST successful fetch of the session
      and treat that as our "baseline". Every later fetch computes the
      OI CHANGE as `current_oi - baseline_oi`. This is the intraday
      definition of OI change (today's flow only), which is the same view
      that opening-range / PCR traders watch in Sensibull, Opstra, etc.
    - The exit rule is on OPTION premium, not on NIFTY spot. We pass
      `stop_underlying=0.0` to the parent's `enter_position` (the parent
      records this for audit only; it does not enforce it) and run our
      own premium-based ratchet inside `_check_premium_trailing_sl_and_exit`.

    SQUARE-OFF SAFETY NET (READ THIS IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT 15:15)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Three different time-based guards work together to make sure we are
    flat by the end of the session no matter what state the worker is in:

    1. `square_off_hour` / `square_off_minute` (= 15:15 by default).
       The BasePaperStrategyWorker's main `run()` loop checks
       `is_after_time(self.square_off_hour, self.square_off_minute)` on
       EVERY single poll iteration against an explicit Asia/Kolkata clock.
       The moment we cross the cutoff, `handle_square_off_and_stop()`
       blocks new entries and repeatedly calls `exit_position("TIME_CUTOFF")`
       on a 1/2/5-second capped retry cadence. The thread reaches STOPPED
       only after its local position and every quantity-bearing ledger leg
       are broker-confirmed flat; the summary is logged after that proof.
       Every scenario is covered:
         - In a trade at 15:15 -> the trade is exited at TIME_CUTOFF.
         - Flat at 15:15 with no signal having fired all day -> the worker
           still reaches FLAT/STOPPED without unnecessary broker orders.
         - Flat at 15:15 but holding a "we already entered once" flag on
           the signal engine -> same as above, the thread exits.

    2. `last_setup_cutoff` (= 15:00 by default). This is SOFTER than the
       hard 15:15 stop. After this time we refuse to OPEN a fresh trade,
       because a 5-min strategy with only 15 minutes of runway is very
       unlikely to make a clean R move before the hard cutoff kicks in.
       Trades already open keep running and follow the trailing SL.

    3. `max_loss` (=Rs.5500 by default). Independent of clock time. If
       realized + open PnL ever dips below `-max_loss` the base loop
       enters the same retrying flatten lifecycle. A non-positive max loss
       may still disable paper-mode risk checks, but fail-closed startup keeps
       that strategy out of LIVE mode.

    EDITABLE KNOBS (all live in `.env` under "OPENING_STRIKE_*")
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Every numeric / boolean parameter the strategy uses -- sizing, the
    trading window, PCR thresholds, ATR/RSI periods, the SL points, the
    derived timeframe, the option-chain refresh budget -- is loaded via
    `_env_*` calls at the top of this file. So you never need to edit
    this class to tune behaviour; just change the corresponding key in
    `Multithreading/Dependencies/.env` and restart the runner.

    CPR Algo 4 -- the operator's "Intraday SRSI VWAP" playbook, fully mechanical.

    The 09:25 close against [MIN(S1, PDL), MAX(R1, PDH)] fixes the day type:
    SIDEWAYS days trade Stochastic RSI reversals with a confirmed-swing stop,
    TRENDING days trade VWAP pullbacks and flip direction on swing structure.
    All of that logic lives in the broker-free `CPRAlgo4Engine`
    (`cpr_algo4_signal_generator.py`), which the backtest drives identically.

    This worker only EXECUTES the engine's answers:
    - it feeds the engine EVERY completed 5-minute bar of today's session in
      order (replaying any it missed after a gap or a restart) but opens or adds
      exposure only on the NEWEST bar -- exits are honoured on any bar;
    - it checks the spot stop / target / R2-S2 level on EVERY poll, so a stop
      does not wait for the 5-minute close;
    - each signal BUYS the ATM CE (LONG) / PE (SHORT) of the next-next expiry
      through the shared `enter_position` path, like the rest of the ATM family;
    - the one R1 add and the two-leg exit started as a copy of the former CPR
      AI worker's mechanics (separate ledger leg, never retried on
      PARTIAL/UNKNOWN, local state kept until both legs are broker-confirmed
      flat). CPR AI's Trend-Day Rider has no add, so this is now the only copy.

    CPR Algo 4 coexists with CPR, CPR Algo 3 and CPR AI: separate position,
    separate live gate (`CPR_ALGO4_LIVE_TRADING`) and a separate Sheet row.

class DonchianBearishWorker(BasePaperStrategyWorker):
    """
    Hedged-CE bearish strategy.

    SPEC RECAP
    ----------
    - ENTRY: on a CLOSED 5-minute candle where the Donchian Bearish signal
      generator emits `startShortTrade == True` AND the wall-clock is inside
      the bearish entry window (09:25 - 10:59).
        * MAIN  (SELL): current-week CE with live LTP closest to Rs.160.
        * HEDGE (BUY) : current-week CE with live LTP closest to Rs.10.
    - EXIT : the signal generator does NOT emit exit signals. Exits come
      from three sources, ALL checked on every poll (not only on new
      5-min candle closes):
        * SL     : NIFTY spot >= entry_spot * (1 + 0.0020) -> EXIT_SL
        * TARGET : NIFTY spot <= entry_spot * (1 - 0.0040) -> EXIT_TARGET
        * 15:14  : universal time cutoff -> TIME_CUTOFF_1514
    - WINDOW : NO new entries after 10:59. Positions opened during the
      entry window keep running until SL/target/15:14 fires.

    EXPIRY RULE: this is the Hedged Puts family, so we use
    `OptionsContractResolver.get_current_week_expiry()`.

    STRIKE RULE: lives in this worker (`_pick_hedged_calls`).

    RUN-LOOP OVERRIDE: the base loop only dispatches when the candle
    signature changes, which is correct for ENTRIES (closed-candle
    semantics) but wrong for EXITS (must respond to live spot moves).
    We override `run` to run SL/target every poll and dispatch entries
    on the signature gate.

# DELTA-0.2 HEDGED SPREAD WORKER (option-chain Greeks driven, dual-side)
# =============================================================================
class Delta20HedgedSpreadWorker(BasePaperStrategyWorker):
    """
    Hedged spread driven by option-chain Greeks, with two INDEPENDENT sides.

    BEGINNER-FRIENDLY OVERVIEW
    --------------------------
    Think of this strategy as TWO completely separate trades that just
    happen to share the same worker thread:
        * "CE side" : a CALL credit spread anchored at a 20-delta strike.
        * "PE side" : a PUT  credit spread anchored at a 20-delta strike.
    Each side has its own entry trigger, its own exit target, and its
    own active/flat state. They do not block or wait on each other.

    The "20-delta" anchor:
        At 09:20, we ask the broker for the live option chain (which
        includes Greeks). The CE we monitor is the call whose delta is
        closest to +0.20; the PE we monitor is the put whose delta is
        closest to -0.20. The premium of each at 09:20 is the "reference"
        we'll compare against for the rest of the session.

    Why these specific entry / exit triggers?
        * Entry on a 5% drop in the monitored premium = "the option is
          getting cheaper, the market is moving away from this strike,
          good time to be a seller". Selling the monitored strike +
          buying a further-OTM hedge gives us a defined-risk credit
          spread.
        * Exit on a 3x rise of the monitored premium = "the option got
          much more expensive, the market is rushing toward our short
          strike, time to close before assignment risk".
        * Strategy-wide max-loss (Rs.5000/lot) is a hard backstop in case
          the spread goes against us before the 3x trigger fires.
        * 15:20 force-close avoids carrying intraday positions overnight.

    SPEC RECAP (the user's brief, in code terms)
    --------------------------------------------
    - At 09:20 IST: pull the live option chain for the current-week
      expiry, pick:
        * the CE strike whose delta is closest to +DELTA20_TARGET_DELTA
        * the PE strike whose delta is closest to -DELTA20_TARGET_DELTA
      Snapshot each leg's premium at that moment as the reference.
    - ENTRY trigger (independent per side): when the monitored CE/PE LTP
      falls to <= ref * (1 - DELTA20_ENTRY_DROP_PCT) (default 5% drop):
        * SELL the monitored strike (main leg)
        * BUY the strike DELTA20_HEDGE_STRIKES_OTM further OTM (hedge leg)
      The CE and PE entries are NOT mutually exclusive - either side can
      enter while the other is still flat or already running.
    - EXIT conditions (per side):
        1. Per-side target: monitored strike's LTP >= ref *
           DELTA20_EXIT_MULTIPLIER (default 3x). Closes only that side.
        2. Strategy-wide max-loss: total realized + open PnL <=
           -(DELTA20_MAX_LOSS_PER_LOT * lots). Closes BOTH sides AND ends
           the worker for the day.
        3. Time cutoff at DELTA20_SQUARE_OFF_*:* (default 15:20). Closes
           anything still open and ends the worker for the day.
      Once a side has exited, it is NOT re-entered the same day. The
      monitor + hedge LTP subscriptions for that side are released.

    EXPIRY RULE
    -----------
    Current-week expiry (`OptionsContractResolver.get_current_week_expiry`),
    consistent with the other hedged-spread strategies in this runner.
    Short-dated weeklies decay fast, which is the seller's friend.

    WHY OVERRIDE `run()` INSTEAD OF USING THE BASE LOOP
    ---------------------------------------------------
    This strategy does not consume OHLC at all. The base loop's "candle
    signature" gate (which only dispatches when the latest 1-min candle
    changes) would gate our triggers as well, even though our triggers
    are driven purely by option-leg LTPs that the central fetcher
    refreshes every poll. Overriding `run` keeps the same risk / cutoff /
    pre-open scaffolding but skips the OHLC plumbing entirely.

    NON-OBVIOUS DESIGN POINTS
    -------------------------
    - `self.pos` (the base-class single-position handle) is intentionally
      left as a flat default. We carry two real positions in `self.ce_pos`
      and `self.pe_pos`. The base risk handlers are overridden to operate
      on both rather than on the unused `self.pos`.
    - Reference capture uses an absolute backoff timer instead of relying
      on the poll cadence, because option-chain requests should not be
      repeated unnecessarily on every 2-second poll.
    - Each side's max_loss is shared, not per-side. The user said
      "5000 per lot for the strategy", so we treat both sides as a
      single risk pool: if the COMBINED PnL breaches the limit, we shut
      down everything.

               Done before entries so a side that just hit 3x closes
               cleanly without confusing the entry path.
            6. Per-side ENTRY checks (independent: CE first, then PE).
               Each side's entry only fires if it is currently flat AND
               has not already exited once today.

        (e.g. a transient network error) cannot kill the worker for the
        whole day - we log the trace and continue on the next poll.

               typically; the helper picks the FIRST listed expiry on
               or after today).
            2. Call the market-data provider's `/optionchain` for that expiry.
            3. Flatten the response into {strike: {ce/pe: {delta, ltp}}}.
            4. Pick the CE strike with delta closest to +0.20 and the
               PE strike with delta closest to -0.20.
            5. Map both strikes (and their hedges 4 strikes further OTM)
               back to instrument-master rows so we have security_ids
               and lot sizes for trade execution / LTP subscription.
            6. Validate that both reference premiums look real (>0).
            7. Persist all of the above as instance state, subscribe the
               4 legs with the central fetcher, and flip the

# LONG STRANGLE WORKER (AlgoTest port; time-based, dual-leg, BUY-only)
# =============================================================================
class LongStrangleWorker(BasePaperStrategyWorker):
    """
    Intraday long OTM strangle on NIFTY weekly options (ported from AlgoTest).

    BEGINNER-FRIENDLY OVERVIEW
    --------------------------
    A "long strangle" is two BOUGHT options held at once:
        * BUY one OTM call (CE) - profits if NIFTY rallies hard.
        * BUY one OTM put  (PE) - profits if NIFTY falls hard.
    Net, it is a bet that the index makes a BIG intraday move in EITHER
    direction; it bleeds slowly (premium decay) on a quiet, range-bound day.

    Like Delta20HedgedSpreadWorker, the two legs are TWO INDEPENDENT trades
    sharing one worker thread: each has its own stop-loss and its own
    active/flat state, and one leg's exit does not touch the other
    (AlgoTest's "Square Off: Partial").

    SPEC RECAP (the AlgoTest config, in code terms)
    -----------------------------------------------
    - ENTRY (once per day, time-based): at STRANGLE_ENTRY_*:* (default 09:30)
      BUY 1 lot of the OTM1 weekly CE and 1 lot of the OTM1 weekly PE. "OTM1" =
      one strike out of the money (CE = ATM+1 step, PE = ATM-1 step; one step =
      ATM_STRIKE_STEP). There is NO indicator and NO signal generator - the only
      entry trigger is the wall-clock.
    - PER-LEG STOP-LOSS: a leg exits when its premium falls to
      <= entry * (1 - STRANGLE_SL_PCT) (default 5% below entry)...
    - PER-LEG TRAILING STOP ("1:1"): ...but the stop trails UP as the premium
      rises. For every STRANGLE_TRAIL_TRIGGER_PCT (%) the premium gains over
      entry, the stop is lifted by STRANGLE_TRAIL_STEP_PCT (%) of the entry
      premium. With both at 1.0 the stop sits a constant 5% below the
      high-water premium once the trade is in profit. The high-water mark only
      ratchets up, so a spike-then-pullback still locks in the gain. (See
      `_compute_trailing_sl` for the exact ladder + a worked example.)
    - EXIT (force): at STRANGLE_SQUARE_OFF_*:* (default 15:15) close whatever is
      still open and stop for the day.
    - MOMENTUM RE-ENTRY (AlgoTest "RE MOMENTUM"): a stopped-out leg is NOT
      re-bought immediately. We keep watching the SAME strike and re-enter only
      once its premium rebounds STRANGLE_REENTRY_MOMENTUM_PCT (default +5%) above
      the stop-out price - confirmation the move resumed in the buyer's favour.
      Repeats up to STRANGLE_MAX_REENTRIES (default 10) times per leg per day.
      Toggle with STRANGLE_REENTRY_ENABLED. (See `_exit_leg` for arming and
      `_manage_reentry` for the trigger.)
    - SAFETY: STRANGLE_MAX_LOSS is a strategy-wide INR backstop across both legs
      (the AlgoTest overall-SL was off, but the live runner always keeps a hard
      cap).

    EXPIRY RULE: current-week weekly (OptionsContractResolver.get_otm_option
    defaults to get_current_week_expiry), matching the AlgoTest "Weekly" setting.

    WHY OVERRIDE run() INSTEAD OF USING THE BASE LOOP

    would needlessly hold back our purely time-and-LTP-driven logic, so we
    override run() to keep the shared risk / cutoff / pre-open scaffolding but
    skip the OHLC plumbing entirely (same rationale as Delta20).

    NON-OBVIOUS DESIGN POINTS
    -------------------------
    - self.pos (the base single-position handle) is intentionally left flat and
      unused. We carry two real positions in self.ce_pos and self.pe_pos and
      override the base risk / exit handlers to operate on both.
    - Each leg's stop-loss is independent, but STRANGLE_MAX_LOSS is a single
      shared pool: if the COMBINED PnL breaches it, both legs close and the
      worker stops for the day.

            Two independent reasons, found together on 2026-07-29:

            1. Instrument. This strategy holds for two to ten minutes. The next-next
               expiry is 7-13 days out — wide spreads, a thin book, and low gamma.
               The method it is distilled from (Intraday Hunter) always trades the
               near/expiring series; every expiry-aware rule in the knowledge base
               was written from that reality, so the agent was reasoning about one
               instrument while holding another.
            2. Live orders. Kotak's RMS allows MIS (intraday) orders ONLY on the
               current weekly or the monthly contract. `get_target_expiry()` lands on
               neither in roughly three weeks out of four, so live entries were
               rejected outright ("MIS ORDERS ALLOWED ONLY IN CURRENT WEEKY AND
               MONTHLY EXPIRY CONTRACT") and silently fell back to paper. This is the
               same failure BNF-002 fixed for the BankNIFTY mirror on 2026-07-23; the
               fix simply was never extended to the NIFTY leg.

            Deliberately NOT mirrored from BNF-002: the near-expiry deep-ITM strike
            shift. That exists because the mirror is mechanical and has no judgement.
            Here the agent decides, and PREMIUM ASYMMETRY in the knowledge base now
            tells it to tighten its booking threshold as ITS OWN contract nears
            expiry — so an expiry-day position is handled by the method, not by
            moving the strike.

    2. Stream the download to a sibling `*.part` file. We never write

       glob only sees one master going forward. The just-written file is
       excluded from the sweep by an explicit resolved-path comparison.

    Failure handling: any exception is swallowed and logged. We must NOT
    crash `main()` here -- the trading session has already finished by the

#
#   * `store.market_data_health.snapshot()` -- it MUTATES the healthy-streak
#     and unhealthy-since fields that drive the 30s liquidation clock, so
#     polling it from a monitor would move a live risk decision.
#   * `worker._get_open_position_pnl()` / `_get_option_ltp()` /
#     `_get_underlying_spot()` -- all three fall back to `broker.fetch_ltp_map`
#     when the cache is cold.
#   * `SessionStateStore.snapshot()` -- it serializes the whole document under
#     the lock `record_trade_event` needs.

    partial file and no log line, so the only evidence was a file mtime found
    hours later -- and it was impossible to tell afterwards whether MainThread
    had blocked, the loop had exited, or writes were failing silently.

    MainThread otherwise logs nothing during a healthy session, so its silence
    carried no information. A periodic line fixes that in both directions: its
    presence shows the loop is turning, and the gap between the last heartbeat
    and the crash localises where it stopped.

    ``last_heartbeat_at`` is ``None`` until the first line is emitted, and that
    sentinel matters: `time.monotonic()` has an arbitrary origin, so a plain 0.0

    now" in a freshly booted Linux container. CI caught exactly that -- the first
