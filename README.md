# My-Algo-Trading-Code
This contains the signal-generation and front-test code. Fyers supplies market data and index history; execution brokers remain independently selectable.

# Live track record
I have been running these strategies **live** (real broker orders) since **May 2026**. The day-by-day results are recorded here:

📈 **[Live results spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y4VgThcLywZbOibKC_pyKbh0A5u1xtgL_cZvyHp3FYg/edit?gid=1173875214#gid=1173875214)**

# The code
Although I own the code, the coding itself was done entirely using GPT-5.4-xhigh, GPT-5.5-xhigh, GPT-5.6 Sol xhigh and Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 5 on Max/Ultracode effort. GPT wrote majority of the signal generators and the data fetch files. Claude wrote the big one - the multithreaded Front Test worker. I just did the reviews and the testing. While Claude Fable 5 did one thorough audit of the whole repository

# What is included?
- Data extractors which extract historical data for NIFTY/BANKNIFTY/FINNIFTY indices
- The backtest files I used to backtest
- The signal generators I created to generate signals
- The main front test file which uses miltithreading to execute all strategies together
- Live order execution to a real broker — selectable among **Kotak Neo**, **Shoonya (Finvasia)**, **Flattrade Pi v2**, and **Dhan** — gated by a global kill-switch and per-strategy paper/live toggles (everything defaults to paper)
- Live Telegram alerts: the front-test master file can post every entry/exit (option instrument, lot size, entry/exit price, and P&L) to a Telegram group/channel
- An **optional, opt-in LLM trading agent** — the "SL Hunting AI Agent" — a Claude agent that trades a discretionary price-action method on NIFTY options; off by default, paper unless explicitly enabled, and fail-soft (see Recent additions)

- An optional **CPR Codex AI Agent** running the **Trend-Day Rider**: a backtested host gate flags midday trend-day candidates, Codex (behind four frozen read-only MCP tools) may only accept or veto them, and every entry sells the opposite current-week ATM option with a VWAP stop; safe disabled defaults and the standard live double gate

# Recent additions
- **CPR AI now trades the Trend-Day Rider.** With CPR Algo 4 carrying the old SRSI/VWAP playbook, the optional Codex agent got a strategy chosen from a five-year study on NIFTY one-minute data and real weekly option premiums from the existing historical dataset (costs and a two-minute decision delay included). The expired-options downloader has since been retired; the study is reproducible only if that dataset is already available locally. Of roughly a dozen ideas tested, one held up: by late morning, a session that has out-ranged its recent ATR and is pinned at one extreme on the trend side of VWAP tends to close near that extreme. The host flags such a bar (start 11:00-13:30, range > ATR5, close in the outer 15% on the VWAP trend side, bullish also needing 2 of 3 confluence factors) through `Signal Generators/CPR AI Agent/cpr_ai_trend_day.py`; Codex may accept or veto it, never reverse it; every entry sells the opposite current-week ATM option (bullish PE, bearish CE) with a fixed VWAP spot stop, no target and one entry per session. Backtest: 264 trades, +9.6 premium points per trade, profit factor 1.69, every year positive (2025-26 weakest); buying instead managed PF 1.27. Reproduce with `python algo.py backtest --strategy cpr-ai-trend-day`. Sold options need naked-option margin; the default `CPR_AI_MAX_LOSS` (Rs 5,500) cuts some recovering trades, see ADR-0019. See [ADR-0019](docs/adr/0019-cpr-ai-trend-day-rider.md) and [`docs/lld/cpr-codex-ai-agent.md`](docs/lld/cpr-codex-ai-agent.md).
- **CPR Algo 4 — the deterministic "Intraday SRSI VWAP" playbook.** A new `CPRAlgo4StrategyWorker` trades the SRSI/VWAP ideas the optional CPR AI agent used to judge with a model (it now runs the Trend-Day Rider, above), but every decision is a fixed rule. The 09:25 five-minute close against the zone [MIN(S1, PDL), MAX(R1, PDH)] fixes the day type: inside it is SIDEWAYS (buy the ATM CE on an oversold Stochastic RSI cross up, the ATM PE on an overbought cross down, stop at the last confirmed swing); outside it is TRENDING in that direction (buy on a close back across VWAP with at least 40% of the body beyond it, RSI and EMA5/20 filters, stop at the entry candle; a lower-high + lower-low or higher-high + higher-low flip cuts the trade and re-enters only through the reversal sequence). Every trade skips a stop wider than 30 points or a next CPR level (less 2 points) nearer than 1:1 and books at buffered R2/S2; `CPR_ALGO4_EXIT_MODE` chooses TARGET (1:1) or TRAIL (breakeven, then candle-by-candle), with an opt-in first-30-minute target and one R1 add on trending longs. It is its own worker — not a fourth algo inside the CPR worker — so it keeps its own position, live gate (`CPR_ALGO4_LIVE_TRADING`, paper by default) and Sheet row, and coexists with CPR, CPR Algo 3 and CPR AI. The broker-free engine lives in `Signal Generators/CPR Strategy/cpr_algo4_signal_generator.py`, and `python algo.py backtest --strategy cpr-algo4` replays the same engine over the 5-year data. Add the Sheet rows `CPR Algo 4 Strategy`, `CPR Algo 4 Strategy [LIVE]` and `CPR Algo 4 Strategy [MIXED]` before relying on its P&L there. See `docs/lld/cpr-algo4.md` and `docs/adr/0018`.
- **Crash-durable session recovery.** Every entry/exit and per-strategy realized-P&L roll-up is atomically persisted during the session, while open positions are refreshed from cache every 30 seconds. A restart archives the exact prior file before writing anything, always carries same-day losses into matching workers so daily max-loss limits cannot reset, and only resumes an open position when the opt-in paper-only validation gate accepts its complete contract and risk geometry. Local shutdown completion and successful Google Sheet publication are recorded separately; see [ADR-0012](docs/adr/0012-crash-durable-session-state.md).
- **CPR Codex AI Agent (independent, opt-in).** `CPRAIWorker` freezes session levels, momentum/VWAP, market structure, and position state once per completed five-minute bar. Codex makes a dynamic regime/setup or premise-exit judgment, while the host alone validates entry geometry, stop distance, levels, sizing, time cutoffs, lifecycle state, and execution. Accepted SIDEWAYS setups are expressed as naked current-expiry premium sells (bullish sells ATM PE; bearish sells ATM CE); TRENDING setups retain the existing ATM CE/PE option buys and expiry. The worker is disabled by default and live-disabled by default; real buys and sells require both `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true` and `CPR_AI_LIVE_TRADING=true`, plus normal startup exposure audit/config validation. A spot stop triggers buy-to-close but cannot guarantee a loss cap through gaps, illiquidity, latency, or a rejected exit. CPR, CPR Algo 3, CPR Algo 4, Regime Adaptive, and CPR AI are independent strategies that may run together with independent positions and independent P&L. The approximately 28-strategy core roster can reach about 30 configured workers when both optional AI agents are enabled, while enable and virtual-trading gates keep the running roster configuration-dependent. Install the exact optional set from `requirements-ai.txt` (shared with SL Hunting); see the [focused CPR AI README](Signal%20Generators/CPR%20AI%20Agent/README.md) for the strategy, isolation boundary, and zero-order smoke commands. *(Its SRSI/VWAP playbook and SIDEWAYS/TRENDING expression were replaced by the Trend-Day Rider -- see the first entry above.)*
- **Config-drift audit — `python algo.py check-env`.** Settings live in three places that drift apart silently: your gitignored `.env`, the committed `env.example` template, and the in-code default behind every `_env_*` call. A key present in the code and the template but missing from `.env` is **not** an error — the runner just uses the in-code default — which is what makes it easy to miss: an unseen default ends up governing a live-money run. This read-only command reports settings missing from your `.env`, mistyped or stale keys (a typo means the setting you intended is not being applied at all), and knobs missing from the template. It exits non-zero on findings so it can gate a pre-flight script, and prints key **names only** — never a value out of your `.env` — so its output is safe to share. CI enforces the same rule in the other direction: a new `_env_*` key cannot land without its `env.example` entry.
- **Per-strategy size multiplier — `<PREFIX>_SIZE_MULTIPLIER`.** One knob per strategy (default **1**, whole numbers up to **25**) that scales that strategy's entire size/risk set together: its lot count, its per-trade risk budget, its hard lot cap, and its daily max-loss kill-switch. At `2` a 5-lot cap becomes 10, a Rs.2,500 budget becomes Rs.5,000, a Rs.5,500 daily cap becomes Rs.11,000, and a setup that would have taken 4 lots takes 8 — so position size can grow with the **account** by editing one number instead of four that must be kept consistent by hand. Deliberately **per-strategy only** (no global switch, so one typo cannot enlarge every enabled strategy) and it applies to **paper and live alike**, so an enlarged size can be paper-validated first. Anything malformed (`0`, `2.5`, `30`, `"two"`) falls back to 1 for paper and **blocks that strategy from live trading** rather than guessing a size. Leave every multiplier unset to trade exactly as before. Two consequences worth knowing: the scaled budget also loosens the "one lot exceeds the budget" skip, and because lots are floored a 2x can land slightly above a pure doubling (still strictly inside the scaled budget). For SL Hunting, note its BankNIFTY mirror already roughly doubles basket risk, so a multiplier of M leaves the basket near 2xM times the single-leg budget.
- **Fyers market data — REST or WebSocket.** `MARKET_DATA_SOURCE=REST` polls Fyers history and quotes. `WEBSOCKET` builds 1-minute candles and option LTPs from Fyers ticks, using REST for warmup and official-candle true-up. Keep the runner in paper mode until Fyers symbols, timestamps, quotes and WebSocket reconnect/health behavior have been validated with your account. The pure tick logic lives in `Dependencies/tick_bar_builder.py`.
- **Per-strategy "off" switch — `<PREFIX>_VIRTUAL_TRADING`.** Every strategy now has a virtual (paper) toggle that **defaults to true**. Set it false to stop that strategy's worker thread from starting at all — so it does no paper trading (and, since the thread never runs, no live trading either). Unlike live trading there is **no** global master switch: the default is that everything runs, and you silence individual strategies. Lets you run just the strategies you want on a given day instead of the whole roster.
- **Quality gates & CI.** A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/quality-and-security.yml`) runs the full gate on every push/PR across Python 3.12 + 3.13: all repository suites, branch-coverage budgets, `pip-audit`, `compileall`, **Ruff**, **mypy** (scoped in `pyproject.toml`), **Bandit**, and pre-commit validation. Exact tooling lives in `requirements.txt` alongside the runtime pins.
- **SL Hunting AI Agent — BankNIFTY mirror basket + newer knowledge (v3c–v3e).** The agent now trades Intraday Hunter's multi-index style: every NIFTY entry is mirrored with an **equal-lot BankNIFTY ATM** leg (`SL_HUNTING_BNF_MIRROR`, default true). The two legs are **tied for hard risk** (stop/target, max-loss, 15:15 square-off close both) but the agent evaluates each leg's **premise independently** and can cut one alone via the EXIT `exit_leg` selector (`NIFTY` | `BNF` | `BOTH`). Entry stays NIFTY-only (the mirror copies it). Its knowledge also grew several distilled-from-video layers — a scoped **gap-up opening-drive**, a **2-week verbatim transcript sweep**, and a **live-day match** against the agent's own journal (details in `Signal Generators/SL Hunting AI Agent/README.md`).
- **Optional LLM trading agent — the "SL Hunting AI Agent" (opt-in worker).** A Claude agent (via the [`claude-agent-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/claude-agent-sdk/) on your Claude subscription — **no API key**) trades the discretionary *SL Hunting* price-action method on NIFTY ATM options. Once per completed 1-min bar (the method's native timeframe) it reads the NIFTY chart (with **BankNIFTY cross-confirmation**) and — only on a confirmed setup at a real level — acts through the SAME tested `enter_position`/`exit_position` path as every other worker. Position sizing floors affordable whole lots, never exceeds `SL_HUNTING_RISK_BUDGET`, skips one-lot-over-budget setups, and caps at `SL_HUNTING_MAX_LOTS` (default 5); the equal-lot BankNIFTY mirror can roughly double basket risk. It **stops opening new positions after 10:30** (`SL_HUNTING_NO_NEW_ENTRY_HOUR`/`_MINUTE`, default 10:30) — *not* a square-off: open positions, their stops/targets, and the 15:15 square-off are unaffected. Its post-exit cooldown starts only when the whole NIFTY/BankNIFTY basket is confirmed flat, so an independently surviving or partly closed leg cannot run the timer down; exits never consult this guard, while unreadable guard state rejects new live entries. It is **off by default** (`SL_HUNTING_ENABLED`), trades **paper** unless both `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` and `SL_HUNTING_LIVE_TRADING` are set, and is **fail-soft** — any agent/SDK error becomes a safe HOLD while its separate mechanical risk loop keeps checking stop, target, max-loss, stale data, and square-off. It can also **learn from its own trades** through a tool-free, schema-validated reflection coach with digest-bound human approval (paper-first, off by default). Install the exact optional stack with `pip install -r requirements-ai.txt` and run one-time `claude setup-token` (keep `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` **UNSET** so it bills your Claude plan, not per-token API). Full details — knowledge, tools, safety model, the learning loop — are in `Signal Generators/SL Hunting AI Agent/README.md`. It joins the configuration-dependent worker roster only when enabled.
- **CPR Algo 3 (multi-instrument) is now wired into the front test.** A new `CPRAlgo3StrategyWorker` runs the "CPR basic setup" strategy, which watches THREE charts at once — the NIFTY spot plus a ~ITM CE and a ~ITM PE of the current-week expiry — and only fires when VWAP and the CPR band align across all three (RSI/ARSI on spot). The two ITM options are **observation only**: a signal still BUYS the ATM CE/PE of the next-next expiry through the same tested path as the other directional workers, so it shares CPR's risk knobs (tunable via `CPR_ALGO3_*` in `.env`, including `CPR_ALGO3_ITM_OFFSET`). It fetches the two option 1-min OHLC feeds on demand and drives its own spot target/stop exit. It belongs to the core roster, while the enabled total remains configuration-dependent. (The standalone Algo 3 signal generator + its unit tests live under `Signal Generators/CPR Strategy/`.)
- **Code-quality pass.** Added a `requirements.txt`; gave every Shoonya broker HTTP call a timeout (a hung call could otherwise stall a worker thread and the shared broker lock); removed hardcoded credentials from the vendored Shoonya client; routed the execution layer's status/errors through `logging` instead of `print()`; and ported the master test suite into the repo (`Tests/test_nifty_multi_strategy_master.py` — see Tests below).
- **Live broker execution is broker-selectable (Kotak Neo, Shoonya, Flattrade, or Dhan).** `LIVE_BROKER` picks `KOTAK`, `SHOONYA`, `FLATTRADE`, or `DHAN`, and every real order goes through one generic `execution_client`. The global `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` kill-switch and each strategy's `<PREFIX>_LIVE_TRADING` flag must both be true; unknown broker names fail closed to paper. Each broker folder contains an execution client and a read-only diagnostic with an optional, typed-`YES`, round-trip test order. Flattrade uses its official Pi v2 browser-token flow, exact NFO index scrip master, documented request limits, market-order protection, and `SingleOrdHist` fill confirmation. Everything still defaults to paper. (Shoonya's legacy QuickAuth endpoint is being decommissioned by Finvasia.)
- **End-of-day P&L is now written to a Google Sheet.** When all workers exit on a clean end of day, the master parses the run's log for each strategy's realised P&L and writes it into a tracker sheet — one row per strategy, one column per calendar day — overwriting today's cell and backfilling any blank earlier-this-month cells from the (append-mode) log. Auth is OAuth user-token via `gspread`; configure `GSHEET_ID` + an OAuth client in `.env` (see Setup). It's a safe no-op when unconfigured, so it never disturbs shutdown.
- **13 TradingBot signal-generator ports.** Thirteen ATM single-leg strategies were ported into `Signal Generators/` (SMA Crossover, Bollinger Bands, Keltner Squeeze, Mean Reversion Z-Score, ML Ensemble, Multi-Timeframe, Opening Range Breakout, Parabolic SAR, RSI Divergence, RSI Reversal, Stochastic, Supertrend, Volatility Breakout), all sharing `misc_strategy_common.py` and the mandatory TA-Lib 0.6.8 indicator backend. They're wired through the shared `AtmSingleLegStrategyWorker` factory and each is tunable from `.env` by its own prefix. ML Ensemble needs `scikit-learn`.
- **Regime Adaptive — one router, two rules.** A fourteenth port through the same factory, but from a different project ([`workratananmol-hub/nifty-options-paper-trading-bot`](https://github.com/workratananmol-hub/nifty-options-paper-trading-bot), MIT). Instead of one rule it reads ADX each bar and switches: an **opening-range breakout** confirmed by VWAP when the market trends, a **fade back to VWAP** when it ranges, and **no trade at all** when ADX is missing — it never guesses the regime. The two candidate rules live in `Regime Adaptive Strategy/regime_candidates.py` as library code with no worker of their own, so the router can never double up on a candidate's signal. Tunable by `REGIME_ADAPTIVE_*`. **Read `Signal Generators/Regime Adaptive Strategy/REGIME_PORTING_NOTES.md` before enabling it live:** this runner receives no volume, so its VWAP is an equal-weight proxy. The source's India VIX and breadth vetoes are **not implemented** — absent by choice rather than for want of data (the source project runs on Dhan too).
- **Bid/ask spread gate — `<PREFIX>_MAX_SPREAD_PCT`.** Most single-leg strategies buy options; CPR AI instead sells one. Either opening side crosses the same quoted market, so a wide spread is an immediate execution cost before the idea has done anything. The runner reads `top_bid_price`/`top_ask_price` off the `/optionchain` response for the exact strike and expiry and refuses an entry quoted wider than the cap. A too-wide spread is refused in **paper and live alike** (it's a market fact, so paper rows stay predictive); an **unreadable** quote refuses **live only** and lets paper through with a warning (an API failure shouldn't cost you a paper data point, but it also shouldn't spend real money on a check that didn't run). Workers share the same option-chain response for three seconds to coalesce nearby calls. **Default `0` — off — for every strategy except Regime Adaptive (2.0)**, so no existing strategy's behaviour changed.
- **CPR (Central Pivot Range) strategy is now live in the front test.** It runs as an ATM single-leg worker (`CPRStrategyWorker`) alongside the other strategies: the master file feeds it 1-min OHLC, the CPR logic resamples to complete 5-min candles internally, and a LONG/SHORT signal buys the ATM CE/PE of the next-next expiry. Tunable via `CPR_*` knobs in the `.env` (lots, max-loss, poll, 09:25-15:15 window). (This brought the master file to nine workers at the time; the running roster is now configuration-dependent.)
- **Read-only live dashboard (optional, off by default).** The runner can serve a browser page on `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` showing open trades with live marks and running P&L, today's closed trades grouped by strategy, per-strategy realized/open/total, and a live NIFTY candle chart. It answers "where do I stand right now", which the log, Telegram and the once-a-day Sheet do not. It is read-only by construction (GET only, never touches the broker, cannot place or cancel an order), binds loopback only with no host setting, and runs on its own thread so it can never delay a trading decision. Switch it on with `DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true`; see `docs/lld/monitoring-dashboard.md`.
- **Telegram trade notifications.** A queue-based `TelegramMessageWorker` posts a message to a Telegram group/channel on every entry and exit from *any* worker. Each alert shows the strategy, the exact option instrument(s), lot size, entry and exit price, and P&L (hedged spreads show both legs). It runs on its own thread so Telegram latency or downtime never blocks the trading loop, and it's a cheap no-op when disabled. See Setup below to switch it on.

```
Each subfolder has its own `Readme.md` with the details.

# Setup
1. Python 3.10+ (I'm running 3.13).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   That covers the core (data fetch, backtests, runner) plus the quality-gate tooling. Install exact optional sets only when needed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-ai.txt        # BOTH AI agents: Claude + Codex SDK, shared MCP stack
   pip install pyotp==2.9.0 websocket-client==1.8.0  # Shoonya runtime
   pip install --no-deps "git+https://github.com/Kotak-Neo/Kotak-neo-api-v2.git@v2.0.1#egg=neo_api_client"
   ```
   Flattrade uses the core `requests` and `pandas` dependencies. Shoonya's NorenApi
   client is vendored, as is TradingView's Apache-2.0 `lightweight-charts` build used
   by the optional dashboard (`Dependencies/dashboard_assets/vendor/`, with its licence,
   an attribution NOTICE and the file's SHA-256). Kotak's official tag declares older exact pandas/requests
   versions, so `--no-deps` prevents it from silently downgrading the audited core
   runtime. `requirements-brokers.txt` records and tests the upstream broker
   dependency environment separately in CI; do not combine it with `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure market-data credentials. Copy `Dependencies/env.example` to `Dependencies/.env` and fill in `FYERS_CLIENT_ID`, `FYERS_SECRET_KEY`, and `FYERS_REDIRECT_URI` from your Fyers developer app (`.env` is git-ignored). The redirect URI must exactly match the URI registered in that app. Generate or refresh the access token with:
   ```
   python algo.py setup-fyers-token
   ```
   The command prints an authorization URL. Open it in a browser, approve access, then paste the complete redirected URL back into the terminal. The command validates the OAuth state and writes `FYERS_ACCESS_TOKEN` into `.env`; it does not display the token. Fyers tokens may expire, so rerun this flow when the token is rejected. If you also choose Dhan for live order execution, fill its separate credential block and run:
   ```
   python "Dependencies/dhan_token_setup.py"
   ```
   This Dhan-only setup flow writes `DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` for order execution. It does not configure Fyers data access. All tunable strategy parameters live in this same `.env`.
   The first front-test start also downloads Dhan's public detailed instrument master if it is not already present; this is contract metadata only and does not require Dhan credentials.
4. (Optional) Turn on Telegram trade alerts by adding these to the master file's `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_ENABLED=true
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_botfather_token
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=@your_channel_or_-100xxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   Create the bot via @BotFather and add it to your group/channel as an admin. Leave `TELEGRAM_ENABLED=false` (the default) to run without alerts. The token stays in `.env`, which is git-ignored.

4b. (Optional) Turn on the read-only live dashboard by adding to the master file's `.env`:
   ```
   DASHBOARD_ENABLED=true
   DASHBOARD_PORT=8787
   ```
   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` while the runner is up. It binds loopback only and there is deliberately no host setting — reaching it from another machine is a reviewed code change plus a token, not a line in `.env`. Every other `DASHBOARD_*` knob has a sensible default and is clamped at read time; see `Dependencies/env.example`.

5. (Optional) End-of-day P&L to Google Sheets. After all workers exit, the master writes each strategy's day-end P&L into a tracker sheet (one row per strategy, one column per day, with month backfill). Enable it by adding to the master's `.env`:
   ```
   GSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
   GSHEET_OAUTH_CLIENT_FILE=Dependencies/gsheet_oauth_client.json
   GSHEET_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE=Dependencies/gsheet_oauth_token.json
   ```
   Auth is OAuth user-token via `gspread`: in Google Cloud enable the Sheets API, create an OAuth client of type **Desktop app**, download its JSON to `GSHEET_OAUTH_CLIENT_FILE`, and share the sheet with your Google account. The first run opens a browser once for consent and caches a token at `GSHEET_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE`. PAPER results use the existing row labels in column A (e.g. `Renko Strategy`); LIVE and MIXED results use separate `Renko Strategy [LIVE]` and `Renko Strategy [MIXED]` rows so real-money outcomes cannot contaminate paper history. Unmatched strategies are skipped with a warning. Leave `GSHEET_ID` blank to disable (safe no-op).

6. (Optional) Live broker execution. Everything is paper by default. To place REAL orders, set in `Dependencies/.env`:
   ```
   LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true        # global kill-switch (default false)
   LIVE_BROKER=KOTAK                # KOTAK, SHOONYA, FLATTRADE, or DHAN
   RENKO_LIVE_TRADING=true          # flip the specific strategies you want live
   ```
   Then fill the selected broker's credential block. Flattrade needs `FLATTRADE_CLIENT_ID`, `FLATTRADE_API_KEY`, and `FLATTRADE_API_SECRET`; its optional `FLATTRADE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is validated when supplied, otherwise startup opens browser authorization and asks for the returned `request_code`. A strategy trades live only when `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED` **and** its own `<PREFIX>_LIVE_TRADING` are both true. An entry falls back to paper only after a typed zero-fill `REJECTED`; `PARTIAL` or `UNKNOWN` means exposure may exist, freezes new live entries, and starts reconciliation. Check connectivity first with the read-only diagnostics — they can place a confirmation-gated round-trip (buy + auto square-off) test order via `--place-order`:
   ```
   python "Dependencies/Kotak API/diagnose_kotak_symbol.py" CE 23950 --place-order
   python "Dependencies/Shoonya API/diagnose_shoonya_symbol.py" CE 23950 26JUN25 --place-order
   python "Dependencies/Flattrade API/diagnose_flattrade_symbol.py" CE 24150 14JUL26 --place-order
   python "Dependencies/Dhan API/diagnose_dhan_symbol.py" CE 24150 14JUL26 --place-order

`algo.py` is a single entry point for every script in this repo via short commands. It just launches the underlying scripts (so each one still works on its own), and any flag beyond the selector passes straight through. From the repo root:

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch-data --index {nifty,banknifty,finnifty}` | Download 1-min OHLC for an index | `python algo.py fetch-data --index nifty --interval 5 --lookback 5y` |
| `backtest --strategy {renko,ema,heikin,cpr,profit-shooter,goldmine,money-machine}` | Backtest one strategy against a CSV | `python algo.py backtest --strategy renko --data "Backtest Outputs/nifty_renko_futures_5y_1min_data.csv"` |
| `run` | Start the front-test master (paper by default; live per `.env`) | `python algo.py run` |
| `setup-fyers-token` | Generate or refresh the Fyers market-data access token | `python algo.py setup-fyers-token` |
| `setup-token` | One-time DhanHQ execution token setup (writes `.env`) | `python algo.py setup-token` |
| `diagnose --broker {kotak,shoonya,flattrade,dhan}` | Read-only broker/symbol check (add `--place-order` for a test order) | `python algo.py diagnose --broker flattrade CE 24150 14JUL26` |
| `check-env` | Read-only audit of `.env` vs `env.example` vs the settings the code reads | `python algo.py check-env` |

Run `python algo.py --help`, or `python algo.py <command> --help`, for the details.

# Typical workflow
1. Pull historical index data — e.g. `python "Data Extractors/nifty_1m_5y_data_fetch_fyers.py"`. The CSV lands in `Backtest Outputs/`.
2. Run a backtest against that CSV — e.g. `python "My Backtest Files (For Reference)/renko_strategy_backtest.py"`.
3. Once a strategy looks good, run `nifty_multi_strategy_master.py` for multi-strategy execution — paper by default, or live once you've configured a broker (Setup step 6).

(Or do all three with the unified CLI above: `python algo.py fetch-data --index nifty` → `python algo.py backtest --strategy renko --data ...` → `python algo.py run`.)

The `Backtest Outputs/` folder is `.gitignore`-d, so generated CSVs/logs stay local.

# Tests
**Every test in this repository lives under `Tests/`, mirroring the source tree** — the tests for `Signal Generators/SL Hunting AI Agent/` are at `Tests/Signal Generators/SL Hunting AI Agent/`, and so on. Runtime folders contain only runtime code.

The front-test master has a unittest suite — env toggles, broker paper/live routing and the fail-closed `LIVE_BROKER` switch, order fill-confirmation, and symbol resolution. Run it from the repo root:
```
python -m unittest Tests.test_nifty_multi_strategy_master
```
Broker/SDK-specific cases skip automatically when optional dependencies are absent, and all broker HTTP/browser/order behaviour is mocked. Signal generators, execution/reconciliation primitives, data extractors, and repository-policy checks have focused suites at their mirrored paths. CI runs the whole quality gate on every push/PR — see "Quality gates & CI" below.

Adding a test? Put it at the mirrored path, and give it a filename that is unique across the repository — pytest keys modules by basename (there are no `__init__.py` files). Where a `Tests/` folder mirrors a source folder whose name contains spaces, it carries a `conftest.py` that puts the **source** folder on `sys.path`, so tests resolve imports exactly the way the runner does. The reasoning is in [`docs/adr/0010-tests-in-a-mirrored-tests-tree.md`](docs/adr/0010-tests-in-a-mirrored-tests-tree.md).

# Quality gates & CI
A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/quality-and-security.yml`) runs on every push and pull request across Python 3.12 and 3.13. Locally, the same gate is:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-ai.txt
python -m unittest Tests.test_nifty_multi_strategy_master
python -m unittest Tests.test_market_data_health
python -m pytest "Tests/Signal Generators" "Tests/Dependencies" "Tests/Data Extractors" -q
python -m coverage erase
python -m coverage run -m unittest Tests.test_nifty_multi_strategy_master
python -m coverage run --append -m unittest Tests.test_market_data_health
python -m coverage run --append -m pytest "Tests/Signal Generators" "Tests/Dependencies" "Tests/Data Extractors" -q
python -m coverage json -o coverage.json
python scripts/check_coverage_thresholds.py coverage.json
python -m pip_audit -r requirements.txt --no-deps --progress-spinner off
python -m pip_audit -r requirements-ai.txt --no-deps --progress-spinner off
python -m compileall -q .
python -m ruff check .
python -m mypy
```
Coverage is branch-enabled: overall runtime coverage may not fall below 74% (CI measures 74.6%; a local run with the optional extras CI does not install — the broker SDKs, scikit-learn — runs 9 tests CI skips and reads ~0.5 points higher — trust the CI number), new execution/reconciliation/data-safety modules require 90%, and every broker adapter requires 80%. The two local audit commands check committed direct pins; CI additionally audits the complete resolved dependency tree in a clean hosted environment. `pyproject.toml` holds the coverage, Ruff, and mypy config (mypy is scoped to the identifier-named modules — the spaced-name master file is covered by `compileall` + the unittest suite instead). `.pre-commit-config.yaml` wires the check-only hooks; install them once with `pre-commit install`.
