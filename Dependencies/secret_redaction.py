"""Shared fail-safe redaction for broker, OAuth, and notifier diagnostics.

Broker replies, login errors, and Telegram failures are exactly the payloads
an operator most wants to see in a log -- and exactly the payloads most likely
to carry a session token, password, TOTP, or personal identifier.  This module
gives every diagnostic call site one shared way to strip those values before
they can reach a log file or an alert.

Which helper to use when
------------------------
- ``redact_text``    : you have ONE string (an exception message, a response
  body, a URL) and want a safe copy of it.
- ``redact_payload`` : you have a STRUCTURE (the dict/list a broker returned)
  and want a safe deep copy -- sensitive KEYS are blanked wholesale, and every
  string VALUE inside is additionally run through ``redact_text``.
- ``RedactingFilter`` / ``install_redaction_filter`` : a last-line guard you
  can attach to a logger so even records someone forgets to redact are
  scrubbed on their way out (DEBUG lines and exception tracebacks included).

Redaction here deliberately prefers false positives (blanking something
harmless) over false negatives (leaking a credential): a blanked field costs a
little debugging convenience, a leaked token is a live-money security problem.
