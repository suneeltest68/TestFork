"""
Shared helper for Fyers index-history download scripts.

Why this file exists:
- Your project already had one NIFTY-only script.
- You now wanted BankNifty and FINNIFTY versions with the same behavior.
- Instead of copy-pasting the full fetch logic many times, this file keeps the
  common flow in one place and lets the thin wrapper scripts only define
  index-specific defaults such as security ID and output CSV name.

High-level flow used by the wrapper scripts:
1. Read command-line arguments.
2. Resolve a concrete date range from either explicit dates or a lookback.
3. Break the full range into bounded chunks so an interrupted Fyers history
   download can resume safely.
4. Download each chunk, normalize the broker response into a clean OHLC table,
   and append it to the CSV as it arrives.
5. Record the progress in a manifest beside the CSV, so an interrupted run
   resumes from the last completed chunk instead of downloading five years
   again.
